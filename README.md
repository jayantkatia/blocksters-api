    1. <a href="https://nodejs.org/en/download/">Install Node.js in your system</a>
    2. <a href="https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/">Install Docker in your system</a>
    3. Make sure you have ```make``` tool installed.

    This sets up and runs your mysql container, creates db in it.

        DB_USER=root
        DB_PASS=secret
